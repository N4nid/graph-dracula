      <p>This is the general UI layout, you are gonna see, when you open the application.</p>

      <h2>Global Menu</h2>
      <p>On the top left, you can see the <b>global menu</b>, which has submenus for <b>file</b> and <b>help</b>.<br>

      </p>
      <h2>Graph View</h2>
      <p>Below the global menu, you will find the big coordinate system, which is your <b>graph view</b>.<br>
      This view always displays a labled coordiante system and all the corresponding <b>graphs</b><br>
      to your inputted functions, equations or parametric functions. (More about that under Text Input)<br>
      - You can <b>move</b> the view around to see different parts of your equations<br>
      &nbsp; by clicking and holding the <b>left mouse button</b>. <br>
      - You can <b>zoom in</b> by scrolling the mouse wheel<br>
      - You can <b>recenter</b> or <b>reset the zoom of</b> the graph view by choosing the corresponding option<br>
      &nbsp; under the menu, that appears when right clicking the Graph View.
      </p>
      <h2>Equation List</h2>
      <p>On the right side of the Graph View, you can see the Equation List. In this list,<br>
      all equations, that you have inputted, are gonna be listed, like in this screenshot: 
      </p>
      <img class="big-img" src="equationListExample.png" alt="equationListExample">
      <p> - You can <b>scroll</b> through the list using you mouse wheel<br>
      - You can right click any listed equation to <b>edit</b>, <b>hide</b> or <b>delete</b> it.<br>
      - You can <b>change the color</b> of an equation's graph with the color picker<br>
      &nbsp; by clicking the colored circle next to it an choosing a new color. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Custom Variables</h2>
      <p>If you use an unknown custom variable in your inputted equation, such as "a", they get automatically added<br>
      in a seperate list, like in the following example: </p>
      <img class="big-img" src="customVariableExample.png" alt="customVariableExample">
      <p>Custom variables have a single letter <b>name</b> and a <b>value</b>.<br>
      - You can <b> change the value</b>  of a custom variable by either<br>
      &nbsp; using the <b>slider</b> or typing the value into the provided text field, where it is displayed. <br>
      - <b>Confirm</b> a typed input by pressing enter or clicking somewhere else in the window. <br>
      - The <b>range</b> for the slider can be easily adjsuted by either inputting new values<br>
      &nbsp; into the minnimum and maximum text fields at the left and the right side of the slider <br>
      &nbsp; or by typing in a value outside of the current range into the value text field.<br>
      To <b>delete</b> an eqaution, just right click and press delete.
      </p>
      <h2>Equation Input</h2>
      <p>On the buttom of the page, there is a text field, where you can type in functions, equations<br>
      parametric functions and if-conditions. To learn more about how to do that, look at the section for text input.<br>
      - To add an input, press enter or click the plus button on the right<br>
      - To change the color of the input graph, click the colored circle on the right<br>
      &nbsp; to open the color picker<br>
      - When you click the up-arrow on the left or press it's <a href = "shortcuts.html">shortcut</a> CTRL + E, you open the expand menu. 
    </p>
    <img class="big-img" src="expandMenuScreenshot.png" alt="expandMenu">
    <p>This menu makes it much easier to type in equations by providing <b>templates</b> for common functionality <br>
    like templates for functions, parametric funtions or if-conditions, special functions like sin(), or constants like Ï€.<br>
    Just click on the corresponding button to input it into the text field. <br>
    To <b>close</b> the expand menu, just click the button again press the <a href = "shortcuts.html">shortcut</a> again or click anywhere not related to the expand menu.
