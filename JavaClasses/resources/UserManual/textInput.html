    <h1>Text Input</h1>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>//text-input-manual</legend>
      <h2>Base types</h2>
      <p>
      In general, graph_dracula uses 3 different renderers to display different<br> tpyes of equations.<br>
      - The fuction renderer renders functions, where for each point on the x-axis<br>
      &nbsp; there is a maximum  of 1 corresponding point on the y-axis.<br>
      - The equation renderer renders equations, that are not functions, like y^2+x^2=9<br>
      - The parametrics renderer renders functions, that are based on the parameter t<br>
      &nbsp; and have a given range like f(t->xy):x=(cos(t));y=(sin(t));for(0&lt;t&lt;2*π)</p>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
      - Functions should generally inputted with the formatting name(x)=function body.<br>
      - The names can only be a single character long and they can't reuse chartacters<br>
      &nbsp; that are already interpreted in a different way, like e (which is a constant)<br>
      &nbsp; round brackets or the names of pre-existing functions or custom variables.<br>
      - You can also use the altrnative formatting or either just inputting the body (like sin(x))<br>
      &nbsp; or write y = body. That means the function of x² could be expressed as<br>
      &nbsp; f(x)=x^2, x^2 or y=x^2.
      </p>
      <h2>Equations</h2>
      <p>
      Equations don't need special formatting, they are just written in the form of body=body.<br>
      Equations also don't have a name, so they are not "reusable".</p>
      <h2>Parametric functions</h2>
      <p>
      - Parametric functions are based on the parameter t and are generally formatted like this:<br>
      &nbsp; name(t->xy):x=(bodyX);y=(bodyY)for(minimum-t&ltt&ltmaximum-t)<br>
      - The body for x and y can't be based on either x or y or pre-existing functions, but only t<br>
      &nbsp; and custom variables.<br>
      - The minimum and maximum body can't be based on x,y,pre-existing functions or t<br>
      &nbsp; but every combination of values and custom variables (like 0.5*sin(b)&ltt&lt(b-0.5))<br>
      - The names for parametric functions can only be a single character long and they can't reuse<br>
      &nbsp; chartacters, that are already interpreted in a different way, like e (which is a constant)<br>
      &nbsp; round brackets or the names of pre-existing functions or custom variables.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>If Conditions</h2>
      <p>If conditions are like an "addon" to any of the above mentioned types of equations.<br>
      They can be used to determine, what parts of an equation are shown. They can be used to define<br>
      a single range, in which an equation is shown, multiple ranges or even infinitely repeating<br>
      ranges (like with if(sin(x)&lt0)).<br>
      - Their formatting is generally: equation;if(if-body) example: y^2;if(y>2)<br>
      - They have to be at the end of the equation and are seperated from the rest of the<br>
      &nbsp; equation with a ";"<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Body Syntax</h2>
      <p>This section explains how to write the body of either an equation (which in this case includes<br>
      functions and parametric functions) or an if-condtion. The body includes things like operators<br>
      special functions, variales etc.</p>
      <h2>Equations</h2>
      Everything mentioned here can be used in the body of any type of equation,range for a<br>
      parametric function or as a part of an if condition. Bodys are calculated follwing<br>
      the general mathematical presidence rules. There are a total of 6 possible<br>
      "components", you can build an equation body out of:<br>
      1. Simple numbers. To write commas, you use a "."<br>
      2. Predefined variables (like x and y for functions or equations or t for parametric functions)<br>
      3. Custom variables (like a etc.). A custom variable has a single letter name and can be used<br>
      &nbsp; acroos multiple different bodys and equations. If the application recognizes a custom variable<br>
      &nbsp; it is automatically added to the <a href = "userInterface.html">UI</a> and you can edit it.<br>
      &nbsp; Note, that if a custom variable name is already the name of a function at the time of input<br>
      &nbsp; it will be interpreted as a function.<br>
      4. Operators, which include: +,-,*,/,^ and mod. They are written like: "body operator body" <br>
      &nbsp; (for example: "2+2"), but there are two exeptions: root and log, which are written as either<br>
      &nbsp; root(n,x) (to get the square root of x, you would write root(2,x)) and log(n,x) (to get log10<br>
      &nbsp; of x, you would write log(10,x)).<br>
      5. Special functions, which are defined as "prefedefined mathematical functions with one input<br>
      &nbsp;  and one output". Their general formatting is specialFunctionName(body), example: sin(x).<br>
      &nbsp; They include: sin(),cos(),tan(),ln(),abs()(=absolute value of),sqrt(=square root of)b.
