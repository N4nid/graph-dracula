<h1>Variable</h1>
<p>Variables always have a name and a double value. If an <a href="EquationNode.html">EquationNode</a> is a variable, it's either x or y (which have to be inputted to calculate), or a parameter, which also has to be in the Variable-Array, which is inputted into the <a href="EquationNode.html">calculate()</a> function.</p>
