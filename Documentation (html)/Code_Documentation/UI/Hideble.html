<h1>Hideble</h1>
<p>This interface is intended to provide a standard for UI-elements, who need to disappear, when you click somewhere else.
    <br> This makes it possible to group such classes in Arrays and bulk hide them. In this case, this happens within the <a href = "ApplicationController.html"> ApplicationController </a> class. 
    <br>This functionality is required, because users exepct a right click window for example, to go away after they interact with something else.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>hide()</h3></li>
            <ul><p>This method is intended to be used to hide() Hideble UI windows. 
                <br>This would be something like a right click menu or the ColorPickerWindow from the <a href = "RoundColorPicker.html"> RoundColorPicker </a> class.</p></ul>
    </ul>
